## UwU what's this?
I didn't like the options I had for Japanese vocabulary decks, so I prompted my way to this one evening. 

## How to run
1. Insert your google service account key json-file into the "google_creds" folder.
2. Create a .env file and insert "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=google_creds/yourprojectname-9f2df31ef964.json"
3. Run convert-txt-to-json to import from words.txt in the format of "å®¶ ie : home, household" (kanji, romaji : english)
4. ... convert-to-csv and make-audio-files are self explanatory :)
